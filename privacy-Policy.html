                <h2 id="websitevisitors">1. Website Visitors</h2>
                <p>Like most website operators, TOPU.IN collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
                    web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
                    referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. TOPU.IN's purpose in collecting
                    non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TOPU.IN's visitors use its
                    website. From time to time, TOPU.IN may release non-personally-identifying information in the
                    aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                <p>TOPU.IN also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                    addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.topu.in blog posts.
                    TOPU.IN only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that
                    it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
                <h2 id="PII">2. Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                <p>Certain visitors to TOPU.IN's websites choose to interact with TOPU.IN in ways that require TOPU.IN
                    to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that TOPU.IN
                    gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment
                    at https://www.topu.in to provide a username and email address.</p>
                <h2 id="Security">3. Security</h2>
                <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
                    transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to
                    use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
                    absolute security.</p>
                <h2 id="Ads">4. Advertisements</h2>
                <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
                    These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
                    advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information
                    allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be
                    of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by TOPU.IN and does not cover
                    the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
                <h2 id="ExternalLinks">5. Links To External Sites</h2>
                <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third
                    party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the
                    Privacy Policy and terms of service of every site you visit.</p>
                <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices
                    of any third party sites, products or services.</p>
                <h2 id="Remarketing">6. TOPU.IN uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h2>
                <p>TOPU.IN uses the remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to
                    previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't
                    completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be
                    in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display
                    Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past
                    visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and
                    Google's privacy policy.</p>
                <p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if
                    you want to you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently
                    using a browser plugin.</p>
                <h2 id="PIIProtection">7. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                <p>TOPU.IN discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to
                    those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
                    information in order to process it on TOPU.IN's behalf or to provide services available at TOPU.IN's
                    website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
                    contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using
                    TOPU.IN's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. TOPU.IN will not rent or
                    sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than
                    to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, TOPU.IN discloses
                    potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a
                    subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when TOPU.IN believes in good faith that
                    disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of TOPU.IN, third parties or
                    the public at large.</p>
                <p>If you are a registered user of https://www.topu.in and have supplied your email address, TOPU.IN may
                    occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep
                    you up to date with what's going on with TOPU.IN and our products. We primarily use our blog to
                    communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you
                    send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we
                    reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us
                    support other users. TOPU.IN takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
                    unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
                    personally-identifying information.</p>
                <h2 id="Stats">8. Aggregated Statistics</h2>

                    should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using TOPU.IN's websites, with the drawback that

                <p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge

                    asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial
                    information required to process those transactions. In each case, TOPU.IN collects such information
                    only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
                    TOPU.IN. TOPU.IN does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
                    And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it
                    may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
                <h2 id="businesstransfers">12. Business Transfers</h2>
                <p>If TOPU.IN, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that TOPU.IN
                    goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
                    transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that
                    any acquirer of TOPU.IN may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
                </p>
                <h2 id="Changes">13. Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
                <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, TOPU.IN may change its Privacy Policy from time to
                    time, and in TOPU.IN's sole discretion. TOPU.IN encourages visitors to frequently check this page
                    for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this
